### social.sodiboo.p.nyet is unavailable
#### 502 Bad Gateway

</hgroup>

Normally, there's a Sharkey instance here.  
But right now, it can't be reached by Caddy.

This server is ran by [sodiboo](https://about.sodiboo.p.nyet).  
It uses Caddy as a reverse proxy to handle requests.  
Mainly, Caddy's job is to multiplex multiple domains  
on a single IP address. Actually, that's its only job;  
because unlike in my real server that this setup is mimicking,  
Caddy is NOT dealing with TLS certificate renewal or ACME.

It is supposed to connect to Sharkey on a local socket.  
But for whatever reason, Sharkey isn't responding.

Usually, this is because Sharkey is still starting.  
It might have restarted due to an update or a reboot.  
If that's the case, it will probably already have started  
by the time you read this. Please refresh the page.  

It may also have crashed, or is down for maintenance.  
If that's the case, you can yell at me.
