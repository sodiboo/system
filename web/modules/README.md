# "isn't the whole repo modules"

yeah basically but this one contains more, like, "general" modules in a more NixOS-idiomatic style, instead of being multi-machine-scoped like the rest of my system. these ones can be more easily copied/referenced in other configs, or more easily upstreamed.

in particular, these ones expose modules that don't "do anything" inherently: gotta enable them elsewhere.
