### This service is unavailable
#### 502 Bad Gateway

</hgroup>

This server is ran by [sodiboo](https://sodi.boo).  
It uses nginx as a reverse proxy to handle requests.  
Mainly, nginx's job is to multiplex multiple domains  
on a single IP address. It also handles TLS and ACME.

It is supposed to connect to another service on a local port.  
But for whatever reason, that service isn't responding.

Usually, this is because that service is still starting.  
It might have restarted due to an update or a reboot.  
If that's the case, it will probably already have started  
by the time you read this. Please refresh the page.  

It may also have crashed, or is down for maintenance.  
If that's the case, please reach out to me.  
You can find my contact information on my personal website.
